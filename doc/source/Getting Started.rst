Getting Started
===============

Describe how to get and build source here.

Get the source code
-------------------

There are two ways of getting the source code for SSAGES: Download a ZIP file
from github or clone the git repository. We strongly recommend the second method
as it allows you to easily stay up-to-date with the latest version.

Download a ZIP archive

    Describe how to select different branches (for different versions).

Clone the repository

.. todo::

    Link to github, describe how to clone git repository. Describe how to check
    out different branches (different versions will be on separate branches).
    Describe how to keep the repository up-to-date.
