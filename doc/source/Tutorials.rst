    Create one very generic tutorial aimed at a user that has no idea of what
    Metadynamics are and that wants to try out SSAGES. Use the most simple
    method and a very simple system. Simulation times should be short and the
    user should be left with a nice animation/nice free-energy landscape.

Here goes a list and description of Tutorials.
